    abstract: |
        The Wire is an American crime drama television series created and
        primarily written by American author and former police reporter David
        Simon. The series was broadcast by the cable network HBO in the United
        States. The Wire premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008,
        comprising sixty episodes over five seasons. The idea for the show
        started out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of
        Simon's writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and
        public school teacher.
